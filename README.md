## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About The Project

**SQL Editor** aims to provide users with a seamless and user-friendly platform for executing SQL queries, displaying query results with pagination, offering search functionality, maintaining a query history log, and supporting the export of results in CSV or JSON formats. The application will also showcase the execution time of queries and provide a list of available tables in the sidebar for easy reference.

### Key Features:

- **SQL Query Execution**: The application will allow users to input custom SQL queries and execute them against the connected database. Users can run SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and other SQL commands.

- **Result Display with Pagination**: The application will present query results in a tabular format with smooth pagination. This ensures that large datasets are easily navigable, enhancing the user experience.

- **Search Functionality**: Users will have the ability to search for specific entries within the displayed results. This feature will assist users in finding relevant information quickly and efficiently.

- **Query History**: The application will maintain a history log of all executed queries. Users can revisit previous queries, review results, and re-run them as needed.

- **Export Data**: Users will have the option to download query results in both CSV and JSON formats. This feature enables data sharing and analysis outside the application.

- **Query Execution Time**: Each query execution will be timed, and the application will display the time taken to complete the query. This information helps users gauge query performance and optimize complex queries.

- **List of Available Tables**: The application's sidebar will display a list of available tables in the connected database. Users can easily reference this list when crafting queries, enhancing their workflow efficiency.
